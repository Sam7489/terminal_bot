# terminal_bot
A minimal terminal-based AI chatbot built using Groq's LLaMA 3 model. It runs fully inside your terminal, remembers conversations in a chatlog.json file, and archives older chats to history.json using a simple -new flag. Designed for fast, command-focused answers and smooth Linux CLI integration.
